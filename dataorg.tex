  \note{
    Spreadsheets are super useful for storing and organizing datasets.
    But how should you arrange the data in a spreadsheet?

    Often, data are arranged as they might appear in a table in a
    paper. This may be pleasing to view, but it can be make
    down-stream analysis difficult.

    Data analysts often spend a lot of time rearranging data prior to
    analysis. Here, I'll take about how to organize data in
    spreadsheets, for ease of analysis.

  \note{
    A particular collaborator's data (not that shown on the previous
    slide) led me to write a website on data organization, which then
    led to this paper.
